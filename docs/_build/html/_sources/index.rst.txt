A package for predicting some light variability parameters of red giant stars.

Red giant power spectra generally look like Figure 1 of Samadi et al. 2016 [2]_:

   :alt: Red giant power spectrum with model components overplotted.

The blue curve represents the component of the spectrum originating from the granulation of the star. In other words, the light variability caused by the appearance and disappearance of "granules," or convection cells on the star's photosphere. The red curve represents the component of the spectrum originating from stellar oscillations.

Red giant asteroseismologists usually focus on the signal received from the star, (i.e. the spikes of the red curve) whose properties have tight relations with the physical properties of the star. However, understanding the background components of these power spectra could also prove useful. 

The granulation component is described by

.. math::

   G(\nu) = \frac{P}{1 + (2 \pi \tau \nu)^\alpha}

and the overall shape of the oscillations component (ignoring the signal spikes) by a Gaussian function of the following form

.. math::

   O(\nu) = H \exp \left[ \frac{- (\nu - \nu_\mathrm{max})^2}{\delta \nu_\mathrm{env}^2 / 4 \ln 2} \right]
